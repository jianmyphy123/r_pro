Now we are going to practice matrix functions!!!
```{r}
A = matrix(c(1,-1,2,0,3,4), nrow = 2, byrow = FALSE)
A
B = array(1:3, c(2,3))
B
is.matrix(A)
is.matrix(B)

A+B
A*B
t(B)
A%*%t(B)
A==B
```

# prove of (A^T)^T = A
```{r}

t(t(A))==A
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
